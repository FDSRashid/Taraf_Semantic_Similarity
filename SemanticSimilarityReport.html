    <h1>Examining Semantic Similarity of Select Tarafs</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hadith are reports of the Prophet ﷺ which express a statement, a action, or tacit approval of an action. Hadith are separated into
        two parts: the isnad, or the chain of narrators starting from the collector of the hadith to the Prophet ﷺ, and the matn, or the actual content
        of the report. Hadith are stored in collections - there are genres of collections guided with a specific aim. For example,
        Sunan are collections organized by topics within legal jurisprudence. Musnads are books organized by the original narrating figure (Kamali 2009).
        Consult Hashim Kemali's TextBook in Hadith Studies or Sh. Furhan Zubairi's Introduction to Hadith Studies for a exhaustive list and description of
        types of hadith collections. Hadith that show up in these collections might have slight variations. These variations could be a few syllable changes,
        or some contextual information about the hadith, or conversations before and after what is considered the main part of the matn. The general report where 
        all varations of a hadiths fall under is called a taraf. A single taraf is composed of numerous hadith that relate this report - each hadith has a 
        variety of isnads. This is the hierarchal scheme that will be used in this article. Tarafs have been classified manually, by X. The 
        methodology is relatively unknown. In order to explore the nature of taraf classification and textual differences within hadith, we aim
        to incorporate models and techniques within Natural Language Processing.  <p>


            <p> Natural Language Processing intersects the field of computer science and linguistics. It involves programming and designing algorithims to
        manipulate speech, analyze and extract contextual information within texts, and more generally, the language itself. NLP tasks involve
        statistical techniques and Machine Learning Models to process tasks. More recently, Neural Networks are used to extract linguistic information.
        Neural Networks are not directly analytical - using numerical algorithms to manipulate and model data. THis allows it to work with large datasets,
        giving it the potential to extract enough information to represent the nuances of a language. The process of NLP involves extracting texts, representing
        them numerically, and using statistical models and Neural Networks to process a set of tasks.
        Tasks can include reognizing text from images, speech recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Semantic Similarity, translation, and more. Languages are so significantly diverse
        that numerically representing every element of a language without preparation will prevent models to successsfully retain relevent contextual information of a text.
        Words that have similar meaning, or are related in terms of syntax need to be accounted for - this would allow models to successfully process important
        information in a text. The process of preparing data for NLP tasks is called pre-processing. Steps for pre-processing texts can include splitting words and puncutation (tokenization),
        removing stop words or words that carry little semantic meaning, orthographic normalization, lemnazation, etc. Our aim is to use NLP to analyze different tarafs
        and explore wheter semantic similarity could be viable in demarcating different tarafs.<p>




            <h3>Aim and Purpose</h3>
            <p>The goal of of this study is to examine the relationship between Taraf Classification and Semantic Similarity. 
                The study will first examine distributions of Semantic Similarity among different Taraf, and evaluate
                 wether there is any consistency. Secondly, I aim to evaluate non-Supervised techniques in grouping hadith into 
                tarafs. Finally, I aim to evaluate the usage of supervised learning techniques to classify hadith to the correct Taraf.

        <h2>  Methodology</h2>

        <section>   
            <h3> Semantic Similarity Calculation</h3>
            <p> 
                Semantic similarity between hadith matns were calculated using a custom made package, Semantic-Similarity-Arabic. 
                There are 5 metrics for semantic similarity being implemented: cosine similarity, euclidean distance, 
                Jensen Shannon Divergence, Jaccard Similarity, and Word Movers Distance. The first three are based on sentence-embeddings.
                They involve using models to transcribe texts into fixed size numerical vectors. This study  uses the CAMeL-Bert Model, trained on
                Classical Arabic, to embed the matns. Using pre-trained models allows scores to be more consistent, and because they
                are trained on a much larger data set they can accurately capture the nuances of a language. 
            </p>
            <p>  Cosine Similarity measures the angle between two vectors in n-dimensional space.
                Given two n-dimensional vectors X and Y, the cosine similarity is defined as:
                 $$ cos(\theta) =  \frac{X \cdot Y}{|| X|||Y||}$$
                 Where ||X|| is called the norm of vector X. For this study, the norm used is the Euclidean Norm, defined as $\sqrt{x *x}$.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Euclidean Distance, also uses unmodified sentence embeddings for its calculation. It is defined as the distance between two
                vectors in n-dimensional space: $$d(X, Y) = ||X - Y ||$$

            </p>

            <p>
                The third metric is Jensen-Shannon Divergence. JS-Divergence measures the similarity between two probability distributions.
                We apply the softmax function to our embedded vectors to return a predicted probability distribution over different tokens. The softmax function for a vector Z made of N real numbers, is defined as:
                $$\sigma(z_{i}) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j \in N} e^{z_j}}$$
                For two probability distributions X and Y, with the average defined as $M = \frac{1}{2} * (X + Y)$, the Jensen-Shannon divergence is as follows:
                $$ JSD(X||Y) = \frac{1}{2} H(M) - \frac{1}{2}(H(X) + H(Y)) $$
                Where H(X) is the entropy of a probability distribution. 


            </p>

            <h3>  Data Collection and Pre-processing</h3>
            <p> 
                The dataset used is a the accumulation of scraped Hadith, Isnad information, and biographer information,
                done by HikmaLabs. The dataset is the largest scraped collection of Sunni Hadith books, with a book selection of over 4000 books.
                The data set features 22321 Tarafs and 442971 Hadith. I sample 30 tarafs randomly, asserting a condition that the number of hadith
                belonging to each taraf is more than 30 but less than 200. I assert at least 30 to assume normality when it comes to data collection, and less than 200 due to the potential problem of computational costs. 
                I preprocess the matns by first converting all unique Arabic Unicode Characters to the standard Arabic Alphanet,
                Unify all orthographic varients of letters, and removing diacretics from the text. Since the classes uses Large 
                Language Models, further pre-processing like removing stop words and lemmatization is not needed. Pre-processing functions are used from 
                Camel-Tools Library.

            <h3> Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
            <p> 
                I first calculate similarity matrices for all 30 tarafs, using the 5 similarity scores described. I retrieve similarity score distributions,
                and display them along side Gaussian Kernal Density Plots for added visualization support. I then sample from each taraf, and combine them into one data set, retrieving
                a similarity matrix and similarity score distributions for all 5 metrics. For Each Taraf distribution using each of the metrics, i return the best fitting probability
                distribution using AIC and BIC.

            </p>

            <h3> Statistical Tests</h3>
            <p> 
               A Correlation P test was conducted on the number of hadith per taraf, and the skewness of the distribution of Similarity Scores.

            </p>

            <section>   
                <h3> Model Development</h3>
                <p> 
                    then i use clustering algorithms to group into 10 clusters or let the 
                    algorithm decide. Then i will use evaluation metrics to determine how
                    well each model grouped hadith into tarafs. A subsidiary approach to
                    the first task is to embedd hadith using transformers. then , use a
                    variety of techniques to reduce data to 2 dimensions then cluster
                    and evaluate or work from there. The second task is to use the same
                    idea with supervised learning (in small scale). Ill grab tarafs with at
                    least 200 hadith each, then split, into training and test data then use
                    different ML models to predict taraf labels. ill be using a variety of evaluation metrics
                    for this as well.
